  <p> Hello everyone! Probably many of you have heard about such things as bitcoin, ethereum, mining or even
    NFT
    ;) Behind all these concepts lies a technology called Blockchain. In this presentation, I tried to
    understand myself and, as far as possible, tell you what Blockchain is. This is a huge topic, and I can't
    tell all the nuances. And since we are developers here, let's look at Blockchain like as a data structure.
  </p>

    Let's start with the Hash Function component. Hash functions are commonly used to check the integrity of
    files or store passwords. Password hashing is used to securely store user data.
  </p>
</aside>

<aside class="notes">
  <p>
    The hash function converts the input information into a bit string of a certain size.
    This string is called a hash.

    A cryptographic hash function must fulfill the following set of criteria
    to be viable for use in a blockchain:
  </p>
</aside>

<aside class="notes">
  <p>
    One-wayness - It has to be easy to calculate an output from a given input but impossible to calculate
    the input from a given output.
  </p>
</aside>

<aside class="notes">
  <p>
    Pseudorandom - A change in the input must result in an unforeseeable change of the output.
  </p>
</aside>

<aside class="notes">
  <p>
    Collision-resistant
    It should be nearly impossible to find two inputs to a hash function producing the same output.
  </p>
</aside>

<aside class="notes">
  <p>
    Deterministic - A given input always needs to produce the same output
  </p>
</aside>

<aside class="notes">
  <p>
    I think at this point that's enough about the hash function
    Now consider the blockchain itself
  </p>
</aside>

<aside class="notes">
  <p>
    Each block contains several elements
    The elements of a block are generally
    separated into the block header and its transactions.
    While the transactions in a block account for most of the data,
    the block header contains essential
    metadata about each block, such as a timestamp and hash of the previous block
  </p>
</aside>

<aside class="notes">
  <p>
    Now let's chain our blocks.
    Looks a lot like a linked list, doesn't it?
    The key difference between a blockchain and a linked list is that
    each reference in a blockchain is cryptographically secured,
    and therefore tamper-evident.
    In contrast, the pointers in a linked list can be changed at any time without affecting the integrity of
    the data. The secured references establish order throughout the blocks and effectively make the
    blockchain an append-only data structure where new data can only be added with new blocks. This means
    you can only add data to a blockchain by appending it to the front.
    The hash value of the previous block is included in the following block header because
    the block hash depends on the data of a block, even changing a single character in one of the
    transactions would invalidate the reference.
  </p>
</aside>

<aside class="notes">
  <p>
    The secured links are constantly checked for validity.
    If you were to insert a malicious block in the
    middle of a blockchain or change data in an existing block,
    for example, between Blocks 1 and 3 in the
    graphic, you could include a reference to its predecessor,
    Block 1. Still, it would be infeasible
    to make Block 3 reference your newly inserted block.

    Each new block built on top of an existing block is commonly known as a confirmation. The older a block
    gets, the more confirmations it will have. Each confirmation makes tampering with the data in a block
    more difficult because you have to recreate additional valid references.
  </p>
</aside>

<aside class="notes">
  <p>
    Okay, that was a boring theoretical part, now let's try to describe it all in code
  </p>
</aside>

<aside class="notes">
  <p>
    First, let's see what a block might look like.
    We have a block number.
    Block creation time.
    List of transactions.
    And the hash of the previous block.
  </p>
</aside>

<aside class="notes">
  <p>
    We can easily describe its structure like this
  </p>
</aside>

<aside class="notes">
  <p>
    Now let's write our blockchain class.
    We will have an array of transactions to add to the new block.
    And the array of blocks.

    In the constructor, we will create a base or genesis block

    We will also have several methods.
    We'll take a closer look at them next.

  </p>
</aside>

<aside class="notes">
  <p>
    Let's start simple.

    This function just takes some data to
    transactions and adds them to the array of transactions for the new block
    Moving on
  </p>
</aside>

<aside class="notes">
  <p>
    A function to calculate the hash of a block.

    The good news is that we don't have to write our own Hash Function,
    For the calculation, we will use a ready-made function from the Crypto library.

    Here we are passing a block to the method.
    We bring the block to the string and calculate the hash of this string according
    to the SHA algorithm
    Next
  </p>
</aside>

<aside class="notes">
  <p>
    This function simply returns the last block in our chain.
    Nothing remarkable
  </p>
</aside>

<aside class="notes">
  <p>
    Here we form a new block.
    Set the index, set the block creation time,
    and ongoing transactions.

    Also here we calculate the hash of the previous block,
    and if it is not there, we generate a hash of some arbitrary string
  </p>
</aside>

<aside class="notes">
  <p>
    The last function traverses the block chain and checks
    whether the hash of any of them has changed.
    If at some stage the hash has changed, then the whole chain is considered
    not valid
  </p>
</aside>

<aside class="notes">
  <p>
    Now let's see how it all works.
    Let's create an instance of the blockchain class.
    Let's add two blocks with transactions.
    And check the validity
  </p>
</aside>

<aside class="notes">
  <p>
    As we can see: we have three blocks with transactions
    And the test passed
    But what if someone changes one of our blocks...
  </p>
</aside>

<aside class="notes">
  <p>
    Let's imagine that
    Someone changed the data in one of the blocks.
    Let's see if validation passes now.
  </p>
</aside>

<aside class="notes">
  <p>
    We see that the data in the second block has been changed.
    But the chain no longer passes validation.
    And the scam failed!
  </p>
</aside>

<aside class="notes">
  <p>
    Well, now you know what the basic structure of the blockchain is and you can try to write your own
    implementation by adding other components, such as "proof of work" mechanism and interaction with other
    nodes.
    And that's all for now.
    Links to presentation and repository with code
    you will find under the video.
    Thanks for watching!
    Bye-Bye!
